# Monte-carlo-simulations-for-US-stock-market
This is a stock market simulator + prediction model for the US stock market. The prediction system is based upon the monte carlo method which in turn uses the concept of Brownian motion for future predictions.

The data is sourced using yfinance library. 

Along with the simulation and prediction of stock prices, this project also works to calculate important financial metrics for stocks such as CAPM, Beta and Sharpe Ratio. 
Further explanations for the code and its working are present in the code itself.
